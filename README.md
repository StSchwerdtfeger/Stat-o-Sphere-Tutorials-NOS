# Stat-o-Sphere-Tutorials NOS

Material that I produced for the editorial collection 'Stat-o-Sphere', published via the 'Students Network for Open Science'
as a project of members of editors of section IV data and statistics. 

The R Basic article consists of a thorough R tutorial, inkl. introduction into various trivial and non-trivial cases of data cleaning and formating, several "hand written" example functions, a shiny app example and a complex Rmarkdown example for reoccuring survey analyses and pdf export. The tutorials are written in a way that they can be mastered by people without any programming or mathematics background, without being superficial on any of the topics, on the contrary. The goal is to save as lot of time as possible by understanding the basics as thorough as needed.
